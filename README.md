# In this project, I've built a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.

This mini-project is based on Python. I did this project on Codecademy which is an interactive learning
platform. In this project, I’ve created a shipping service that tells the customer which shipping method will be
the cheapest based on the package’s weight. There are two shipping methods for the shipping service, each
method has a premium service too. The first shipping method is ‘Ground Shipping’ and the second is ‘Drone
Shipping’ followed by their ‘Premium Shipping’.
